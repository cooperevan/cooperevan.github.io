## the profession

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Santa Barbara with a BA in environmental science looking to dive into the world of conservation, wildlife management, ecology, really anything that gets me outside.

I had the opportunity to travel to Peru during my undergrad to study the ecology of different rain forest habitats, and was introduced to the conservation efforts to combat the resource extraction present in the amazon rain-forest such as deforestation, mining, and over-hunting.

## the hobbies

Anyone who knows me knows you will always find me outside. You could find me surfing up and down the coast of California, out on the crags rock-climbing, or on any number of hikes.

## the strava

Below is an interactive map I created of my Strava activities, with the help of Daniel Cullen's post [here](https://www.dancullen.me/articles/creating-a-heatmap-in-r-with-google-polylines)!

```{r}
library(httr)
library(rStrava)
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(googleway) 
library(mapview)
library(webshot)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# create the authentication token
stoken <- httr::config(token = strava_oauth(app_name, 
                                            app_client_id, 
                                            app_secret, 
                                            app_scope="activity:read_all", 
                                            cache = TRUE))
saveRDS(stoken, "strava_token.rds")
```

```{r}
app_name <- 'evanstrava' # chosen by user
app_client_id  <- '162797' # an integer, assigned by Strava
app_secret <- '81a499b604a026d0a5fad0be6faf02266f663749' # an alphanumeric secret, assigned by Strava

stoken <- readRDS("strava_token.rds")
```

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
my_data  <- get_activity_list(stoken)
act_data <- compile_activities(my_data)

keeps   <- c('map.summary_polyline', 'upload_id')
my_acts <- select(act_data, match(keeps, names(act_data)))

#setting the map
map <- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(zoomControl = FALSE)) %>%
  addProviderTiles('CartoDB.Positron',
                   options = providerTileOptions(noWrap = TRUE, minZoom = 7, maxZoom = 20)) %>%
  setView(lng = -119.8606, 
          lat = 34.4133, 
          zoom = 14)

#loop in data using DC code
loop <- unique(my_acts$upload_id)
for (i in loop) {
  activity <- filter(my_acts, upload_id == i)
  coords   <- googleway::decode_pl(activity$map.summary_polyline)
  map      <- addPolylines(map, lng = coords$lon, lat = coords$lat,
                      color = 'darkorange', opacity = 1/4, weight = 3)
}

map

saveWidget(map, file="runningmap.html") #export the final map
```
