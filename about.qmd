## the profession

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Santa Barbara with a BA in environmental science looking to dive into the world of conservation, wildlife management, ecology, really anything that gets me outside. I had the opportunity to travel to southern Peru during my undergrad to study the ecology of different rain forest habitats, and was introduced to the conservation efforts to combat the resource extraction present in the amazon rain-forest such as deforestation, mining, and over-hunting.
